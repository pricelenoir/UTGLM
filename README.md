## Project Overview
We designed a Doppler radar-based golf launch monitor to be used in tandem with a weight distribution board equipped with load cells. This system is designed to determine a user's center of mass throughout their golf swing and provide real-time feedback to improve swing mechanics.

This repository contains the source code for the embedded devices that interact with:
- **Load Cells**: Measure weight distribution and visualize center of mass shifts with interactive GUI.
- **Golf Launch Monitor**: Used to measure club head speed and generate an estimated shot trajectory.
- **Web Visualizer**: A demo web application to display data and insights from the system for user analysis.
